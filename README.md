# ❄️ Snow Day Calculator  

Ever wondered if tomorrow will be a snow day?  
This project explores how weather data and school closure history can be used to **predict the probability of a snow day**.  

👉 Try the full **[Snow Day Calculator](https://snowdaycalculator.ca)** for real-time predictions.

## 📖 About  
The Snow Day Calculator estimates the chance of school closures based on:  
- Local weather forecasts (snowfall, temperature, storm intensity)  
- Historical school closing patterns  
- Regional climate factors  

This repository provides:  
- A **demo interface** (static mock-up)  
- A **technical breakdown** of the prediction logic  
- Resources and datasets for exploration

## 🚀 Live Demo  
Check out the demo site here:  
- [GitHub Pages Demo](https://hamid0234.github.io/snow-day-calculator) *(UI-only version)*  
- [Full working tool →](https://snowdaycalculator.ca)

## 🔧 How It Works (Simplified)  
1. Collect weather forecast data for your region  
2. Apply a probability model based on snowfall thresholds  
3. Factor in school closure history for better accuracy  
4. Output: **chance of a snow day (%)**

## 📊 Example Data (Sample)  
| Date       | Snowfall (inches) | Temp (°F) | Snow Day Probability |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| Jan 12, 2024 | 6.5               | 25°F      | 85%                   |
| Feb 04, 2024 | 2.0               | 30°F      | 30%                   |
| Mar 15, 2024 | 10.2              | 20°F      | 95%                   |
